### Your project idea

An application called SkyMap Connect. It incorporates a weather API and google maps API that allows the user to search for the weather in their area and also navigate to see what is around them.

### List of components and their children components if any

-Header Component

-Result Component (displays result)

-Search Component (search form)

-MapDisplay Component (displays result)

-Footer Component

The way this will work is the search form input will apply to both the MapDisplay Component and the Result componnet by passing the long and lat of the location of the city to map it.

### User stories

-As the user I want to be able to search any city I live in or visit to see what the weather is and what is around me

-As the user I want to be able to see a map displaying all roads and locations

-As the user I want to be able to navigate around the map and see where things are

-As the user I want the application to be easily accessible

### MVP

-Needs an API from google maps and openweather

-I want the search form to be fully operational

-No errors or bugs (method to catch them if they exist)

-Should be easy to operate

### Stretch Goals

-sign in functionality to add a To do list depending on the location searched (this is a big streetch goal)

### Wireframes

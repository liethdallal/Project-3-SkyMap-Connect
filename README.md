### Your project idea 
A Weather Tracker application. It incorporates a weather API that allows the user to search for the weather in their area!

### List of components and their children components if any
-Header Component 
-Forcast Component (displays result)
-Search Form Component 
-Footer Component 


### User stories
-As the user I want to be able to search any state and city I live in to see a forecast of what the weather will be like 
-As the user I want to be able to see details at specific times of that weather 
-As the user I want to be able to have a list to choose from to just see what the weather is like around the U.S 
-As the user I want the application to be easily accessible 


### MVP
-Needs an API 
-I want the search form to be fully operational
-No errors or bugs (method to catch them if they exist) 
-Should be easy to operate 

### Stretch Goals 
-Make a full detailed display of specific days the user clicks on 
-Maybe make the application any country instead of just a U.S API
